✈️ FYP-Airline-NLP
Analysing the Impact of Airline Service Factors on Passenger Well-being Using NLP

📌 Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse British Airways customer reviews.
The goal is to identify how airline service factors (e.g., food, staff service, comfort, and amenities) influence passenger well-being, including emotional, mental, physical, and dietary health.

🎯 Objectives

To identify and extract the key airline service factors from passenger reviews using topic 
modelling.
To map the extracted airline service factors to different passenger well-being dimensions. 
To evaluate how the identified service aspects affect different dimensions of passenger well
being.
